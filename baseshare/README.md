Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```

## Production

Build the application for production:

Now you can run the following commands to lint your code:

- **`yarn lint`** or **`npm run lint`**: Check for linting issues.
- **`yarn lint:fix`** or **`npm run lint:fix`**: Automatically fix linting issues.
